## Projects

* **[Recommender Systems](https://github.com/ctrnh/recommender_systems)**: A recommender system trained on Jester Dataset, using collaborative filtering. \[Still working on it. This is my minimum viable product at the moment!\]

<br />

* **[MLPerf Datasets](https://github.com/ctrnh/mlperf_mobile_datasets)**: A program which processes a given dataset such as Google Open Images, to mimic the features of Imagenet/ADE20K/COCO datasets. I wrote this program in collaboration with [Michael Buch](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michael-buch-24441b9b) and within the mobile team of [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org/en/). This program was then used for the mobile app of MLCommons. 

<br />

* **[Goose Game](https://github.com/ctrnh/goose_game)**: An implementation of the [Goose Game ("Jeu de l'oie")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose) in Java.

## Implementations for my personal understanding
I like to reimplement algorithms or play with new concepts I learn to get a better understanding of their inner workings and subtleties. These repositories contain several algorithms that I have studied either in class (sometimes in group), doing research or on my own. 


* **[Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/ctrnh/machine_learning_algorithms)**:
*Fundamentals of machine learning algorithms/concepts, and applications to toy problems.*
  - Logistic regression
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)/ Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
  - Expectation-Maximization algorithm
  - K-means
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

<br />

* **[Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/ctrnh/reinforcement_learning_algorithms)**: *Some implementations of classic algorithms, applied to toy environments such as cartpole*
  - Reinforce
  - Actor Critic

<br />

* **[Trajectory Optimization](https://github.com/ctrnh/trajectory_optimization)**: *Optimal control algorithms, elegant theory, and interesting to compare to black box Reinforcement Learning algorithms for simple problems such as cartpole* 
  - Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
  - iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR)
