<center> <span style="font-size:1.4em">Hi, Welcome to my webpage! </span></center>

<br />
I'm a new graduate from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay) with a *Master in Mathematics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning* (Master "MVA"), the leading Master's degree in machine learning in France.

During my studies, I had the great opportunity to publish papers in the field of multi-armed bandits with Prof. [Emilie Kaufmann](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/) and Prof. [Richard Combes](http://rcombes.supelec.free.fr/index.html). I also developed multiple internal tools such as a computer vision fine-tuning pipeline during my internship at [Wintics](https://wintics.com/en/front-page/), a computer vision startup which focuses on analyzing traffic videos.

* Happy to share our new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10200) and [code](https://github.com/ctrnh/multi_player_multi_armed_bandit_algorithms) with Prof. Richard Combes, about Randomized Selfish UCB, an elegant algorithm which performs far better than state-of-the-art algorithms in Multi-player Multi-armed bandit problems without collision information.

* Feeling down today? Talk to [Jokey](https://github.com/ctrnh/recommender_systems), my new jokes recommender system!
